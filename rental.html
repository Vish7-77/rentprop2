        <h2>What is a Rent Agreement?</h2>
        <p>
          A rent agreement is a written contract between the property owner (the
          landlord) and the tenant who rents the property. It also contains the
          terms and conditions under which the property is rented, such as its
          description (location, kind, and size), monthly rent, security
          deposit, property's usage (residential or commercial), and the
          agreement's duration. Terms and conditions can be discussed
          beforehand, but the landlord and the tenant are bound by them once
          signed. It also lays forth the terms under which the contract can be
          cancelled.
        </p>
        <p>
          The lease agreement form, as a legal document, is highly vital. The
          rent agreement online protects the rights of both parties and prevents
          future disagreements. During the lease term, there may be various
          disagreements between the landlord and the tenant. Such disputes could
          be tackled well through a contract. It offers the landlord's property
          security and protects tenants against unreasonable demands.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rental agreement document also provides the tenant with the
          ownership of the property for a set length of time. As we all know,
          verbal agreements are not enforceable by law, and it is usually a good
          idea to sign a written contract. Another crucial aspect is that it
          serves as a piece of legal evidence that can be presented for several
          identity proofs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rent agreements can be set for whatever time the parties desire or
          agree. It can be renewed according to the conditions of the agreement.
          The rent agreement’s length is usually 11 months, which is to get over
          the rigorous rental rule which applies to lease agreements of up to 12
          months. Also, an important point to remember is that, according to the
          Registration Act 1908, any property leased to a tenant for more than
          11 months must be registered. Hence, a property on the agreement for a
          few months or less than 11 months does not require registration.
        </p>
        <p>
          An online rent agreement protects you from misunderstandings, doubts,
          and disagreements about renting or leasing property. Get into an
          actual rental or leasing agreement if you want to experience calm and
          transparency along the way. This agreement contains essential
          elements, such as property information, rent due, advance deposit, and
          property-related terms and restrictions.
        </p>
        <p>
          One must be vigilant about several aspects while signing a rent
          agreement online, such as the format, registration process, the house
          rental agreement form, the lease agreement form, the notice period,
          etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          This type of legal agreement may appear perplexing at first glance, so
          here's a breakdown of the rent and lease agreement form, style,
          distinctions table, importance, and house rent form, among other
          things.
        </p>
        <h2>Why is Rent Agreement Necessary?</h2>
        <p>
          A legally binding and registered rent agreement is necessary for the
          harmonious relationship between the parties (landlord and the tenant)
          as it safeguards their rights from fraud, future disregard, doubts,
          fights, and legal issues. Getting into a genuine and registered rent
          agreement or lease agreement form helps the owner and the tenant have
          a more calm, transparent, and formal relationship. The lease agreement
          form consists of some extremely dominant information like the
          property's details, rent you agreed upon, the advance deposit, and
          restrictions (if any) regarding the property.
        </p>
        <p>
          To create a rent agreement online or a lease, then it also assures the
          tenant of the security of living at the property with pre-agreed terms
          and conditions and all other details without expecting surprises.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, the agreement benefits the owner by giving them a certain type
          of legal hold over the property. Another important advantage of
          registering a rental agreement is that it serves as legal proof and
          can protect the landlord in the event of a future legal issue. When a
          significant asset, such as a residential property, is involved, the
          landlord requires a document that protects them legally in the event
          of a future disagreement or resistance from the other party.

        <h2>Types of Rent Agreements</h2>
        <p>
          When a property is rented, be it commercial or residential, several
          legal documents such as a rent agreement, lease agreement form, or
          licencing agreement define the relationship between the landlord and
          the tenant to curb unnecessary disputes in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, what does an agreement mean? A lease agreement form is a legal
          document that spells out the terms and circumstances of a lease or
          rent partnership between two people, i.e. (the owner and the tenant).
          There are different agreements for renting or leasing a property, as
          stated earlier. The rental agreement document comes under the Rent
          Control Act, and the Leave and License agreement comes under the
          Indian Easement Act.
        </p>
        <p>
          An agreement consists of some basic property details, the details of
          the owner and the tenant, the term of the agreement, and the amount to
          be paid as rent. The three types of rental agreements are as follows:
        </p>
        <div class="underList">
          <h3>Rent Agreement</h3>
          <p>
            A rent agreement is a written contract between the property owner
            (the landlord) and the tenant who rents the property. It contains
            the terms and conditions under which the property is rented,
            including its description (location, kind, and size), monthly rent,
            security deposit, usage (residential or commercial), and agreement
            duration.
          </p>
          <p>
            The rent agreement can be acquired for a shorter period of only 11
            months. If the agreement exceeds the time of 11 months, then it is
            necessary to get a registered agreement.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Transfer of Property Act, Specific Relief Act, Evidence Act, and
            Registration Act, among others, are significant legislation that
            governs the tenancy agreement, and one should be thorough with all
            of these to be on secure ground.
          </p>
          <h3>Lease Agreement</h3>
          <p>
            A lease agreement is usually for a more extended time than a rent
            agreement. A lease agreement form is a contract between the landlord
            and the tenant that grants the tenant the right to use the property
            for a specified period of time (generally more than 12 months).
          </p>
          <p>
            This agreement binds the landlord and the tenant for the agreed-upon
            duration, from 30 to 99 years.
          </p>
          <p>
            A lease also generates an interest in the transferable property and
            creates rights that can be inherited.
          </p>
          <p>
            The lease agreement assures that the lessee does not evict the
            premises unless it is indicated explicitly in the agreement. A legal
            notice might also be served on the lessee. To be valid in a court of
            law, a lease deed must be stamped and registered (in case of
            disputes).
          </p>
          <p>
            According to tenancy law, the person who receives the rent is the
            landlord. In a dispute, the person allocated to receive the rent has
            the authority to take all legal steps necessary to have the
            agreement either precisely performed or the property removed by
            instituting appropriate legal actions in a court of law.
          </p>
          <h3>Leave and License Agreement</h3>
          <p>
            A Leave and License Agreement is a legal instrument that allows the
            licence holder to use the Licensor's property. However, the property
            is granted under a Leave and License agreement rather than a tenancy
            arrangement. Therefore, the property right would be invalid without
            it.
          </p>
          <p>
            The leave and license agreement come under the Indian Easement Act
            1882, and it is not similar to the lease or rent agreement.

          What is the Process of Creating the House Rent Agreement Online?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Making a rental agreement online is available through a variety of
          internet sites. Squareyards.com offers a service which is fast and
          efficient. While the processes may differ depending on the platform,
          the basic procedure includes the following elements:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Fill in the information on the landlord, tenant, property address,
          and lease terms, such as lease period, monthly rent, and security
          deposit amount, among other things. Depending on your preferences, you
          can choose between a lease arrangement and a leave and licence
          agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. You will need to preview the created agreement to ensure that all
          the details entered are correct. Once you preview the details, the
          payment shall be made on the platform using any acceptable payment
          method, such as UPI, debit card, etc. The appropriate stamp duty
          charge (which you may have to calculate), convenience charge, and
          delivery price (which vary by platform), as well as the applicable
          Goods and Services Tax, will be included in the payment (GST).
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The platform will have the online lease agreement printed on proper
          stamp paper and mailed to you. If you prefer a soft copy, you can have
          the e-stamp and the online lease agreement emailed to you. The online
          hard copy of the rent agreement usually takes 3-5 business days to
          arrive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Squareyards offer online rental agreements that allow you to sign the
          contract digitally. After the payment for the service has been made
          and the agreement has been formed, the signatures of both parties will
          be asked. Following that, both parties will have the option to share
          the agreement and digitally sign it. The online rental agreement can
          be downloaded after both parties have signed the agreement. You can
          also avail free rental agreements in India.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>NOTE:</strong> Digital signatures are legally recognised under
          Section 5 of the Information Technology Act of 2000.

        <h2>What is the Stamp Duty on Rent Agreement?</h2>
        <p>
          Stamp duty is a tax levied by the government on various property
          transactions. You must pay stamp duty when you buy a home or sign a
          rental agreement. Section 3 of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899, mandates
          the payment of stamp duty.
        </p>
        <h2>What is E-Stamping in the Rental Agreement?</h2>
        <p>
          E-stamp paper or E-stamping is a method of electronically paying stamp
          duty to the government. The government has replaced the conventional
          paper and franklin stamping approach with a digital plan to ensure a
          quick and trouble-free payment process. This service is currently
          available in 22 Indian states.
        </p>
        <h2>Registration Charges of the Rental Agreement</h2>
        <p>
          The cost of registration varies by state. There are also stamp duty
          charges to consider. These, too, differ by state. In Delhi, for
          example, stamp duty on a home rented for five years is 2 %.
          Furthermore, you can check out multiple rental agreement samples to
          know the registration charges better. You can also avail free rental
          agreement in India with several resources.
